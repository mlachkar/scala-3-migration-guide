title: Macros migration
---
The Scala 2 macros are compiler dependent. In other words, macros defined in a Scala 2 library cannot be consumed by a different compiler version.

Scala 3 will break this limitation but it comes with the cost of rewriting all the macro usages of the Scala ecosystem.

## Migration status

While being experimental, the Scala community has largely adopted the Scala 2 [Def Macro](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/overview.html) feature in multiple of ways: code generation, optimizations, ergonomic DSLs...

Here is an incomplete list of libraries that use Scala 2 macros and their migration status:

* [sourcecode](https://github.com/lihaoyi/sourcecode) – cross-compiles to Scala 2 and Scala 3
* [utest](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest) – cross-compiles to Scala 2 and Scala 3
* [intent](https://github.com/factor10/intent) - compiles to Scala 3
* [xml-interpolator](https://github.com/lampepfl/xml-interpolator) - compiles to Scala 3
* [expression-evaluator](https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/expression-evaluator) - not migrated, no replacement for `Evals.eval` 
* [jsoniter-scala](https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala) - not migrated, no replacement for `Evals.eval`
* [minitest](https://github.com/dotty-staging/minitest) - ported to Scala 3 in the Dotty community build but not merged to upstream
* [munit](https://github.com/dotty-staging/munit) - ported to Scala 3 in the Dotty community build but not merged to upstream
* [scalatest](https://github.com/dotty-staging/scalatest) - ported to Scala 3 in the Dotty community build but not merged to upstream
* [scodec-bits](https://github.com/dotty-staging/scodec) - ported to Scala 3 in the Dotty community build but not merged to upstream

## How to?

### Before rewriting a macro

Before getting deep into reimplementing a macro your should check if it can be supported using Scala 3 new features.

* Can I encode the logic of the macro using the new scala 3 features?
  * [List of Scala 3 features](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/overview.html)
* Can I use *match types* to reimplement the interface of my macro?
  * [Match Types](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/match-types.html)
* Can I use `inline` and the metaprogramming features in `scala.compiletime` to reimplement my logic?
  * [Inline](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/metaprogramming/inline.html)
  * [`scala.compiletime`](http://dotty.epfl.ch/api/scala/compiletime/index.html)
* Can I use the simpler and safer expression based macros to implement my macro?
  * [Simple macros](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/metaprogramming/macros.html)
* I really need to have access to the raw AST trees
  * [TASTy Reflect](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/metaprogramming/tasty-reflect.html)
  * [TASTy inspector](http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/metaprogramming/tasty-inspect.html)

A good reference for this is [Shapeless 3](https://github.com/dotty-staging/shapeless/tree/shapeless-3). It uses Scala 3 features most of the time for a feature that would have been macros in Scala 2 and only uses macros where absolutely necessary.

### Defining a project that cross compiles macros

If you are already cross-compiling your macro for different versions of Scala 2 and you have sources folders for each version, then you can add an extra source folder for Scala 3.

* SBT examples:
  * *TODO find a simple example project*
* Mill examples
  * *TODO find a simple example project*
  * [utest](https://github.com/dotty-staging/utest/tree/dotty)
  * [sourcecode](https://github.com/dotty-staging/sourcecode/tree/dotty-community-build)
